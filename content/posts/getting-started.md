I rebuilt my website from scratch using Hugo instead of using WordPress. On one side, to save some of the hosting costs. On the other side, I wasn't happy with the limitations imposed on me by WordPress.

Don't get me wrong, if you want to quickly and easily make a website, then WordPress is usually a good choice. But that's not what I'm after. My personal website consists of static pages, will be updated on a once or twice per month at the most, and does not require any fancy features. This means that I don't really need all the extra bells and whistles. With Hugo, I have full control over the website content, and I can optimize the pages to *only* contain what I need.
